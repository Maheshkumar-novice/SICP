```scm
(define (square x)
  (* x x))

(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
	(cond (predicate then-clause)
	(else else-clause)))

(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
	(new-if (good-enough? guess x)
			guess
			(sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))

(define (improve guess x)
	(average guess (/ x guess)))

(define (average x y)
	(/ (+ x y) 2))

(define (good-enough? guess x)
	(< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))

(define (sqrt x)
	(sqrt-iter 1.0 x))

(sqrt 1000)
```

If we use `new-if` we will get infinite recursion. Because `new-if` is a function at if the scheme interpreter uses the applicative order then it would result in `infinite` recursion.

I think in normal order it would work as expected. Because argument evaluation done only when required.
