Exercise 1.4: Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. 
Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

```scheme
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```

Here if b > 0 then a + b will happen (+ a b)
     else a - b will happen (- a b) that means a + abs(b) (a - (-1))

From this we observe that we can get operators via expressions.
