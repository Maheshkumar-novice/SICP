This alternative “fully expand and then reduce” evaluation method
is known as normal-order evaluation, in contrast to the “evaluate the
arguments and then apply” method that the interpreter actually uses,
which is called applicative-order evaluation.

(define (p) (p))
(define (test x y)
(if (= x 0) 0 y))

(test 0 (p))

In applicative-order, we will get infinite calls due p calls itself.
In normal-order, depends on the value of x the operation differs.
